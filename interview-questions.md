# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is the local and Github is the Global or online

Researched answer: Git is a free, open-source version control system widely used in the programming world. GitHub is an online platform that uses git version control technology. 


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: index is the location the value is what is at that location

Researched answer: Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Each element in the array must be a JavaScript data type. The content of each element is called the value.

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: The Four pillars of OOPs, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, are integral to understanding and using OOP.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher-order Functions: A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. Often higher-order functions are designed to operate on arrays. The function passed as an argument will execute once for every item in the array. This makes higher-order functions incredible useful for iteration.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. The Jest framework is made up of a collection of files called dependencies which contain snippets of code functionality. Using all these code snippets together in the right way will give us the ability to run tests.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods. This makes objects the intersection of data and behavior.
